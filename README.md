# IW6x GSC Menu Base

## Basic Info
- Not all my original work, took the old mw2 base everyone uses and put it into IW6x <br />
- Place _clientids.gsc in %Game Directoty%/iw6x/scripts <br />
- You can add your own files, pretty much the same as other games <br />
- This is just a base, you still have to do most of the work <br />
- Controls are setup for controller: <br />
  - Open Menu = Left Trigger + Dpad Down <br />
  - Select = X/Square <br />
  - Back/Close Menu = Knife <br />
  - Scroll Up = Dpad Up <br />
  - Scroll Down = Dpad Down <br />
